title: "Research and mentorship"

Research is a vector for expression of ideas that allows one to leverage data to guide care and influence the way clinicians practice - this carries an immense responsibility. As a surgeon and developer I live at an interesting intersection - analyzing large datasets, applying the latest methodologies in data science, and making sense out of chaos is an area that intrigues me. 

Here are a few areas that I am exploring beyond the publications listed below:
- Application of machine learning techniques to structured data in healthcare 
	- Predicting locally advanced disease in clinically early stage rectal cancer - are we missing those who might benefit from neoadjuvant therapy?
	- Can we develop tools to aid in the identification and biopsy of neoplasms during endoscopy? 
- Understanding patterns of cancer care in academic and community settings and how they might influence care - how do we optimize care irrespective of setting
- Use of software to improve peri-operative care and outcomes after ostomy creation

Please see my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Q43MriQAAAAJ&hl=en) and [PubMed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=william+kethman) profiles for a complete listing of publications.

In addition to my research interests, I am committed to mentorship - until now, I have applied my experiences in building health technologies and clinical practice to mentor groups of students in solving unmet needs in healthcare.
